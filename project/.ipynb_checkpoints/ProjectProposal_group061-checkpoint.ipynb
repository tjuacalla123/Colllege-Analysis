    "Although each college has their admission process and policy, most four year colleges require their applicant to submit their SAT or ACT test scores. Many college admissions offices use test scores such as the SAT and ACT in order to determine whether a student will be admitted. In most cases, students with higher SAT scores are believed to have better chances of being admitted to the top-ranking colleges. However, how much weight does the SAT score actually carry in a college application? Our background research shows that although there are other factors that influence college admissions and it is difficult to generalize exactly how much weight does the SAT score carry, there is no doubt that SAT score plays an important role in college admissions, especially among the more selective colleges.\n",

    "An ideal dataset would include different universities and the SAT scores for the accepted applicants. Columns would store the names of universities and the test scores of the applicants. In order to get the most accurate results, it would be best to have information on multiple colleges. A dataset that is granular and has abundant information about the logistics of the schools (tuition fees, total amount of students, location, etc) would also be helpful. Additionally, there would have to be a variety of data on schools that are considered to be more prestigious in order to see the difference in scores."
